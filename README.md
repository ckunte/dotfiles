# dotfiles

These are the files that reside in my home folder (~).

## Setting up a computer

1. Copy all the files from this repo to the home folder
1. Install [vim-plug]
1. Install [housekeeping scripts][hkp]

### macos-specific

1. Install command line tools: `sudo xcode-select --install`
1. Install [Homebrew] and run `brew bundle install` from ~/

The above requires _Brewfile_, which can either be created afresh or saved from another computer using `brew bundle dump`. (_Brewfile_ is included in this repository.)
